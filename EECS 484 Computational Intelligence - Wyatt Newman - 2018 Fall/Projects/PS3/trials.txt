trial 2 - 8x8?
trial4 - new implementation - 500000 iterations, alpha at 0.1, max rad at 3. 6x6 matrix, exp decay

trial5 - like 4 but 50000 iters and normalized features, exp decay

trial6 - max rad at 2, 250000 iters, alpha at 0.25, 6x6, exp decay

first few trials used bubble neighborhood(1-3), (4-7) use Gaussian neighborhood

trial7 - max rad at 3, 250000 iters, alpha at 0.5, alpha=1/curr_iter  (linear decay)

use Epanechnikov neighborhood function and power series learning rate decay
trial8 - 115000 iters, max rad at 3, alpha at 0.5

use cut gaussian neighborhood and power series learning rate, linear
radius decay

trial9 - 100000 iters, max rad at 3, alpha at 0.5

use exp decay learning rate, 8x8 matrix
trial10 - 100000 iters, max rad at 3, alpha at 0.5
